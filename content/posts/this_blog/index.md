## Introduction

As the things are happening this probably will be the second post in this blog. I started writing about some stuff like my current undergraduate research and thoughts about the FLOSS community, but given the way things are going in my head, this will be the first to be ready.

My idea with this post is to describe things that I find relevant about this blog, like the technologies behind, the workflow I designed, and some random stuff that I think are cool. So, the idea is less like it to be purely informative, and more like how I usually talk about things I'm interested in. But feel free to use it as informative material :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:.

## Why I started a blog?

I kind of talked about it a little in my confusing [previous post](../hello_world), but I think it's worth mentioning here too. 

It all happened a few days ago when I finally got a break from college, after handing in the last project I needed to finish the semester. I've wanted to start producing content for the internet for a while now, but I've never gotten the traction to start. One morning I woke up specifically wanting to know how the **FLOSS&H** (*here I'm using **FLOSS&H** as Free and Open Source Software and Hardware, because I don't know a better acronym for it*) initiatives were going for modern computing trends, such as AI, personal assistants and etc..., but I didn't find anything that satisfied my curiosity. So as an act of indignation *fueled by copious amounts of free time* **I decided to finally become what you may consider a content creator!**

In case you ask yourself:
> Oh so he will soon make a post about those tendencies? 

Short answer: **NOPE!** At least **not so soon**. The reason that I really doesn't know so much about them to just start writing interesting things about. But certainly this blog encourages me to study these topics so I can write some stuff about them.

So that's the short story, and here I am a content creator without any content and followers, like Yato from Noragami, at least I started with a shrine. But however, differently from him I'm not struggling to gain followers and wanting to become well-known, my idea is just to write about stuff that I like in the way I find inserting. But if you like it too, feel free to subscribe to the [Blog Feed {{< icon "rss" >}}](../index.xml) and enjoy the content!

> Note:  I didn't configure the RSS feed's cloud pub-sub mode, but you can add the feed to your favorite aggregator anyway.
