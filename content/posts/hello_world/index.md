This is the first post I'm making on my blog. After a full day's journey just setting up the infrastructure, I finally managed to get it up and running! In case you're wondering how one can have so much trouble setting up a simple blog using a framework like HUGO, a pre-made theme, and the github-pages system, know that anything can be complicated if you want it to be! More specifically, if you want things a certain way. When it's not just about having a solution but having it exactly the way you want it, even the simplest task can become complex.

I'll give an example with this blog! It wasn't enough to have it up and running to start writing. I needed to manage the project using Nix, a package manager I love but have zero expertise in. I'm very grateful for the hours spent; I think it turned out well for a first attempt, and I had a lot of fun in the process. I hope to document the technical journey and the technologies used in a future post.

In the end, despite the headache I went through (which, in this case, I'm still experiencing while writing this first post), I'm truly fascinated by the steps I had to take to get this minimal blog setup (which resulted in about 30 minutes of audio for various colleagues). That's precisely why I wanted to create this blog, not only to annoy my close friends less but because I'm simply passionate about certain subjects, and I often feel that some of them aren't approached the way I'd like them to be. This will cover various topics spanning the field of computer science, as well as thoughts about the FOSS community. Anyway, even though I don't really know what I'll be writing about exactly on this blog, I'm sure it will be about things I like and believe are worth sharing my opinions on the internet.

I think I'm running out of ideas on what to write, so I'll end the post here. Stay tuned for more posts, whether they be poorly written thoughts like these, "theses" with somewhat organized arguments, technology tutorials, and perhaps even culinary recipes. One day, I'll master the art of making my favorite dessert: red berry cheesecake, and share it here, why not? It's my blog. I realized I haven't introduced myself, but I think I'll save that for a "About Me" section that I'll get around to writing later.

See you later!
